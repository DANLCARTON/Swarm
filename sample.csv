"A few points: 1. Northern Hemisphere snow cover has been increasing since the 1960s. 2. It's been a mild winter so far in Europe, but no significant Alpine warming in 50 years. 3. 6,000 years ago, the Alps were ice-free."
"Global warming sets record cold temperatures in Siberia"
"15 years ago in climate idiocy... the Fort Worth Star-Telegram melts down over 2006 being the ""warmest year ever."" But 2022 was 1.1°F cooler than 2006 & only 0.1°F warmer than 1954 - more than 100 ppm CO2 ago."
"ANTARCTICA HAS NOT WARMED FOR OVER 70 YEARS"
"Claims in the IPCC report AR6 WG1 SPM of the rate of sea level rise accelerating are mostly from splicing together an average of tide gauges to 1993 & satellite data thereafter."
"It was the year without a #summer -- In 2022 Sydney didn’t even reach 32 degrees C (90F) for the first time in 163 years at #Sydney Observatory. More #CO2 and less extreme heat than ever.  Where were the headlines? #Unprecedented!"
"All of the warming began in 1850 at the end of the 500-year little ice age. The rise is about 1.4 degrees in 170 years. In climate terms that's hardly measurable & of no consequence for anything in the world. And the CO2 is directly linked to the very warm 11.7K yr Holocene."
"Wow... December 2022 (420 ppm CO2) was 0.20°C cooler than December 1987 (350 ppm CO2)... despite a doubling of manmade CO2"
"December 2022 was cooler than December 1987, despite a doubling of manmade CO2. To overcome this PR disaster for CO2 warming hoax, climate propagandists will be pretending that Europe is melting in January. "
"That is not a problem is it? It's the natural world and CO2 is part of the cycle of life. But it does not set changes in the weather. It's key role is photosynthesis.  Polar bears are fine. Witches are not real."
"When carbon dioxide is produced it immediately circulates and moves through the air. It is denser & heavier than air and tends to pool lower down in the atmosphere, hence the timberline. There is no way possible to examine the air & know how/where CO2 came from from isotopes"
"Carbon dioxide is not a pollutant & never was. It's a miracle compound in air, sea & land that maintains oxygen & all life through photosynthesis. At higher levels it is effective at boosting plant growth & will not/can not change temperature or make oceans rise. It's a hoax"
"Brits already paying record prices for electricity. Offshore wind industry wants even higher prices. We are all being totally ripped off by our corrupt governments and the wind/solar/EV industry thieves via the climate hoax"
"World climate hasn't changed, not by 1 degree. The worst case scenario - a 1 degree rise since 1860. But this is doubtful. No visible ocean rise anywhere. No islands-cities flooded & abandoned. No climate deaths. No evidence carbon dioxide changed climate. Only the hoax remains."
"72 hours of wind collapse again in Germany. Germany's new government wants to rid the grid of coal and gas by 2030. At least Germans won't have to pay the highest electricity prices in Europe anymore...  because there won't be any electricity."
"⚠️ ""Due to Biden’s folly, oil, natural gas and #electricity prices have more than doubled in just a single year. Meanwhile, more than 28 percent of Americans abstained from purchasing food or medicine to pay an #energy bill in 2021."""
"Massive adjustments to the Vestmannaeyjar (Iceland) temperature record by NASA GISS"
"My claim is that the media are biased, and the #BOM_au doesn't understand the climate. A warming trend that started before our emissions rose only proves something else drives the climate. Prove me wrong."
"Do Google Search Options Conceal Climate Data that is Contrary to Government Alarmists Propaganda?"
