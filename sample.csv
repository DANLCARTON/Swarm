"Climate Embarrassment: Anthropogenic Climate Change is a Hoax but Global Warming is¬†Real"
"The climate crisis has contributed to a lack of demand for heating so far this winter. So if the ""climate crisis"" is saving Europe from catastrophe, is it really a ""crisis""?"
"Your vague statement does not exclude some of the warming being natural. This is one of a number of supposed consensus statements. All worthless from an evidence-based science perspective. But empty claims of authority are great for maintaining a pseudo-religious cult."
"Climate hoax pushers outraged at Elon Musk for allowing climate reality to flow.\n\n2022 was the year that doomed the Climate Axis of Evil:\n\n1. No warming for 8 full years\n2. Climate idiocy-caused energy crisis\n3. Return of free speech to Twitter"
"Actual evidence is useless. Climate alarmism is a pseudo-religious cult, with a priori beliefs of CAGW & the necessity to reduce CO2 emissions. Everyone who believes is an expert. Everyone who questions orthodox belief is deluded.\nGroupthink is science & normal science is lies"
"Marcott? Is that all you have? Ever thought about the resolution of those proxies and why modern thermometers will find temperature spikes the proxies from 5000 years ago will never see? Slap on instruments guarantees a hockeystick. Yawn."
"‚ö†Ô∏è ""Due to Biden‚Äôs folly, oil, natural gas and #electricity prices have more than doubled in just a single year. Meanwhile, more than 28 percent of Americans abstained from purchasing food or medicine to pay an #energy bill in 2021."
"UK extends life of coal plant by two years... because although the UK had record wind power last year... windmills still don't really work."
"Frozen Wind Turbines & Solar Panels Leave Thousands of Americans Freezing In The¬†Dark"
"Despite COVID, fossil fuel production in China soared in 2022, with coal and gas hitting record highs.\n\nTwo points:\n\n1. Global emissions are never going down.\n\n2. Emissions cuts are only weakening the West, internally and vs. China"
"Carbon Dioxide Causes Domestic¬†Violence"
"Just like Polar Bears in the Arctic, Bengal Tigers in India are making a comeback."
"That is not a problem is it? It's the natural world and CO2 is part of the cycle of life. But it does not set changes in the weather. It's key role is photosynthesis. Polar bears are fine. Witches are not real."
"What is the effect of 1-2% of extra CO2? Net TEMP effect after natural system feedback, not gross perturbation? Change now is not measurably different in rate, range & period from past cycles. We observe no unnatural anomaly from 140ppm more CO2. Discuss. "
"Remember the global warming con is about CO2-driven warming‚Ä¶ not all warming, which has many causes."
"Very few scientists have ever tried to write a paper on the principles of the greenhouse effect hypothesis. Most just start with the implicit unquestioned assumptions. It's a crock of a theory. Arrhenius and Ekholm had no idea the radiative equilibrium T of CO2 is only ~206K."
"Climate dogma is more CO2 = more warming.\n\nSo how does that explain these trends?\n\nIt doesn't. \n\nEven alarmist [deleted mention] admits the CO2 explanation is ""hopelessly unphysical.""\n\nAlternative: El Ninos (not CO2-driven) work as step-drivers causing the general warming trend."
"The point is Keith, climate was not invented in the past 40 years as a product of carbon dioxide. The long term natural forces will continue to regulate weather, and this is then looked at over longer periods to see if there is a change to climate. That time is a long way away."
"The Medieval Warm Period was warmer than the present"
"The early mammal reptiles, the dionapsids, cooevolved with dinosaurs before the end Permian. We are mammals, so mammal forbears were around for 300m years. Life took a giant leap in the Cambrian explosion 540m years ago. Climate and life coexisted in hotter times. We are tropical"
"A few points:\n\n1. El Nino/La Nina events havef been driving Pacific Ocean temperatures and global temps.\n\n2. The El Nino/La Nina cycle isn't CO2-driven.\n\n3. Has Climategater Kevin Trenberth ever been correct about anything? "
"It was the year without a #summer -- In 2022 Sydney didn‚Äôt even reach 32 degrees C (90F) for the first time in 163 years at #Sydney Observatory.\nMore #CO2 and less extreme heat than ever.  Where were the headlines? \n#Unprecedented! "
"Climate shocker:\n\nNot a single extreme weather record set in the US during 2022, per NOAA.\n\nNo record temperatures, rain, snow or wind."
"Extreme storms are not more likely. In Texas in 2021, wind went from 25% to 5% because of freezing vanes."
"This 4 inches was from the satellites, so the average of all the oceans. The average of tide gauges was about half that. But beware not to annoy the climate gods, or they will command Neptune to level up by sending a 2 inch tsunami to engulf us."
"Antarctica‚Äôs Missing Warming: Japanese Syowa Station Shows Cooling Since¬†1977"
"Remove the two non-CO2 related effects of the past 30 years (1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption and 1998+ El Nino) and the global warming 'pause' dates back to the dawn of global warming hysteria. h/t [deleted mention] \n\nCO2 warming is a hoax."
"CENTRAL ENGLAND TEMPERATURE RECORD SHOWS WARMING HAS SLOWED¬†DOWN"
"Dr. Roy Spencer posted his top 10 years of temperature satellite data. I have extracted the last 8 years from this, thus giving the following sequence starting from 2015 to 2022. Dr. Roy acknowledges 2021 & 2022 were influenced by La Ni√±a Cooling, will 2023 continue with cooling?"
"North America and Greenland had the third largest snow cover on record in November 2022.\n\nBut recall:\n\n- March 2000 (The Independent, UK): 'Children just won't know what snow is.'\n\n- February 2014 (NYTimes): ""End of Snow?""\n\nClimate is a hoax."
"A few points:\n\n1. Northern Hemisphere snow cover has been increasing since the 1960s.\n\n2. It's been a mild winter so far in Europe, but no significant Alpine warming in 50 years.\n\n3. 6,000 years ago, the Alps were ice-free."
"Wow... December 2022 (420 ppm CO2) was 0.20¬∞C cooler than December 1987 (350 ppm CO2)... despite a doubling of manmade CO2"
"My claim is that the media are biased, and the #BOM_au doesn't understand the climate. A warming trend that started before our emissions rose only proves something else drives the climate. Prove me wrong. "
"The big picture is that the warming trends started before  we built coal plants, and their climate models are junk. If the sun caused global warming, the seas would rise, ice would melt and summers would get hotter too. The experts don't know what drives these natural cycles"
"It wasn‚Äôt so long ago California prayed for rain. Something to quench the climate-change-fueled drought ‚Äî the worst in at least 1,200 years.""\n\nWaPo @sarahkaplan48 is too dumb to wonder what caused the drought 1,200 years ago?ü§î\n\nNon-stop propaganda."
"There is no credible evidence that any of these damages were caused or increased by emissions or slight warming (regardless of cause).\n\n2022 climate damage claims debunked: https://t.co/68mBu0LGWR\n\nhttps://t.co/xsMFPQgId3 via @business https://t.co/FaNOfTp5up"
"December 2022 was cooler than December 1987, despite a doubling of manmade CO2.\n\nTo overcome this PR disaster for CO2 warming hoax, climate propagandists will be pretending that Europe is melting in January"
"32 years ago today in the history of climate idiocy: 'Will we stop [global warming] destruction in time?'\n\nThere never was any debate.\n\nClimate started off as a hoax and nothing has changed"
"Hoax: ""The latest storms vividly illustrated the consequences of warmer sea and air temperatures caused by climate change.""\n\nReality: December 2022 was the coolest December since 2013 and even cooler than December 1987."
"There‚Äôs no climate change occurring from CO2 emissions.\n\nThere has been no discernible CO2 warming since climate idiocy began.\n\nThere seems to have been very slight warming from other causes but that still isn‚Äôt ‚Äúclimate change.‚Äù\n\nThe alarm is all a hoax."
"Double the manmade CO2 and no warming means CO2 warming is a hoax‚Ä¶ one that is a hallmark of the @NRDC, which the last GOP Congress was investigating for being funded by Communist China."
