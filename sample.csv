"Nonsense. Once you include the endless renewable subsidies (a third of a TRILLION this year alone in the US) &amp; the cost of backup power for when they don't produce, you cannot point to one single grid-scale solar or wind project that is cheaper than fossil fuels.\n\nI'll wait"
"After years of harassment and weeks after her resignation there is finally going to be an investigation into the University of Sussex. \nWhy cannot academic disputes be resolved in the academic literature? Are the trans consensus insecure in their perspectives? "
"There is a long term decline in carbon dioxide, and this could lead to a collapse in life if it continues. Any 8ncrease inbCO2 will not cause warming. Water vapour gives 95 % of the ability to sustain  warmth in the atmosphere."
"Your vague statement does not exclude some of the warming being natural. This is one of a number of supposed consensus statements. All worthless from an evidence-based science perspective. But empty claims of authority are great for maintaining a pseudo-religious cult."
"Temperatures rose by 1.4 degrees since 1850, at the end of the 500 year Little Ice cage. CO2 would be expected to be higher at the end of an 11,700 year warm interglacial, where it was warmer than today 65 per cent if the time."
"Chart displaying the output of our local star over 200 years.. you can see during the past 60 years there has been a very active Sun.. no doubt the co2 from out planet was the cause of its high output.. not. The cooling process has started.. via the record Triple La Ni√±a"
"It was the year without a #summer -- In 2022 Sydney didn‚Äôt even reach 32 degrees C (90F) for the first time in 163 years at #Sydney Observatory.\nMore #CO2 and less extreme heat than ever.  Where were the headlines? \n#Unprecedented! "
"There is no credible evidence that any of these damages were caused or increased by emissions or slight warming (regardless of cause).\n\n2022 climate damage claims debunked: https://t.co/68mBu0LGWR\n\nhttps://t.co/xsMFPQgId3 via @business https://t.co/FaNOfTp5up"
"Marcott? Is that all you have? Ever thought about the resolution of those proxies and why modern thermometers will find temperature spikes the proxies from 5000 years ago will never see? Slap on instruments guarantees a hockeystick. Yawn."
"Wow... December 2022 (420 ppm CO2) was 0.20¬∞C cooler than December 1987 (350 ppm CO2)... despite a doubling of manmade CO2"
"North America and Greenland had the third largest snow cover on record in November 2022.\n\nBut recall:\n\n- March 2000 (The Independent, UK): 'Children just won't know what snow is.'\n\n- February 2014 (NYTimes): ""End of Snow?""\n\nClimate is a hoax."

"NetZero destroys NetZero: Europe can‚Äôt make solar panels because green electricity costs too¬†much"
"The point is Keith, climate was not invented in the past 40 years as a product of carbon dioxide. The long term natural forces will continue to regulate weather, and this is then looked at over longer periods to see if there is a change to climate. That time is a long way away."
"A long- (longest-?) term review of hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. \n\nResearchers at the National University of Mexico reviewed data going back to the year 1749 and found that 'from 1749 to 2012 the linear trend in the number of hurricanes is decreasing.'\n\nClimate is a hoax."
"A few points:\n\n1. El Nino/La Nina events havef been driving Pacific Ocean temperatures and global temps.\n\n2. The El Nino/La Nina cycle isn't CO2-driven.\n\n3. Has Climategater Kevin Trenberth ever been correct about anything? "
"Earth's climate is locked into the Pleistocene ice age, which has lasted 2.59m yrs. The world's been cooling steadily for 50 million years. If any warming did take place, it would be a blessing &amp; saviour for human society. Cold is the biggest killer in world history, not warmth."
"""As climate change causes global temperatures to rise, ancient animal remains and human artifacts are emerging from melting glaciers and permafrost.""\n\nLOL.\n\nSo why was it so warm before the animal remains and human artifacts froze?"
"This 4 inches was from the satellites, so the average of all the oceans. The average of tide gauges was about half that. But beware not to annoy the climate gods, or they will command Neptune to level up by sending a 2 inch tsunami to engulf us."
"Climate shocker:\n\nNot a single extreme weather record set in the US during 2022, per NOAA.\n\nNo record temperatures, rain, snow or wind."
"Green energy is Chinese energy, you dummy.\nPrayers for the climate!"
"Double the manmade CO2 and no warming means CO2 warming is a hoax‚Ä¶ one that is a hallmark of the @NRDC, which the last GOP Congress was investigating for being funded by Communist China."
"Climate idiocy to spike Aussie electricity prices by 35% in 2023.\n\nThe weather will remain the same.\n\nAustralians will just be ripped off"
"Actual evidence is useless. Climate alarmism is a pseudo-religious cult, with a priori beliefs of CAGW & the necessity to reduce CO2 emissions. Everyone who believes is an expert. Everyone who questions orthodox belief is deluded.\nGroupthink is science & normal science is lies"
"WHY WIND TURBINES WILL NEVER SUPPLY ENOUGH ELECTRICITY FOR OUR¬†NEEDS"
"In the current ice age, a glacial lasts up to 100K years and an interglacial 10K years. The Holocene warm interglacial has lasted 11.7K years. This diagram superimposes the Holocene on the last 3 interglacials. I reckon we're already going into the big freeze. Our lifetime?"
"‚ö†Ô∏è ""Due to Biden‚Äôs folly, oil, natural gas and #electricity prices have more than doubled in just a single year. Meanwhile, more than 28 percent of Americans abstained from purchasing food or medicine to pay an #energy bill in 2021."
"79% of all global energy comes from fossil fuels \n\nRenewables produce 16%\n\nmost of it from wood (11%) and hydro (3%)\n\nSolar + wind is 1.8% of global primary energy"
"Carbon dioxide - the building block of life on earth - has been in decline for 600M yrs, down to 180ppm 10k yrs ago. The warm Holocene added fresh energy to animal/plant life. The meteoroc rise of human civilisation, with cities &amp; agriculture, explains today's modest rise in CO2."
"Climate hoax pushers outraged at Elon Musk for allowing climate reality to flow.\n\n2022 was the year that doomed the Climate Axis of Evil:\n\n1. No warming for 8 full years\n2. Climate idiocy-caused energy crisis\n3. Return of free speech to Twitter"

"Climate change is a scam"
"Days get longer when the wind blows. -- Tallbloke identified this 13 years ago."
"I'm sorry, but 3 mammals and 6 birds going extinct in 500 years, none of them from habitat reduction, is not evidence for the claims of a habitat-driven 6th wave of extinctions."
"A confused ‚Äòfact-check‚Äô from Agence France-Presse (AFP) claims that the Daily Sceptic published a misleading claim in saying: Studies of Greenland show climate change is caused by natural factors, not carbon emissions."
"The big picture is that the warming trends started before  we built coal plants, and their climate models are junk. If the sun caused global warming, the seas would rise, ice would melt and summers would get hotter too. The experts don't know what drives these natural cycles"
"My claim is that the media are biased, and the #BOM_au doesn't understand the climate. A warming trend that started before our emissions rose only proves something else drives the climate. Prove me wrong. "
"There‚Äôs no climate change occurring from CO2 emissions.\n\nThere has been no discernible CO2 warming since climate idiocy began.\n\nThere seems to have been very slight warming from other causes but that still isn‚Äôt ‚Äúclimate change.‚Äù\n\nThe alarm is all a hoax."
"If by chance you are among the dwindling number who still believe in the oracular doomcasts of the Tinkertory‚Ñ¢ climate models, READ HER POST. \n\nThe computer climate models do no better than throwing dice."
"""Most don‚Äôt realize the vital role natural gas plays in food security. It's the core ingredient in the production of ammonia &amp; the power source to produce fertilizer... 70% of the cost of nitrogen fertilizers is the cost of natural gas."""
"A hurricane is not climate change. Nor is rainfall, storms or winter snow. They are all just the the weather. This concept of weather has been hijacked by a global warming frenzy, that has been relentless for 33 years. We must see a return to common sense."
"32 years ago today in the history of climate idiocy: 'Will we stop [global warming] destruction in time?'\n\nThere never was any debate.\n\nClimate started off as a hoax and nothing has changed"
"It wasn‚Äôt so long ago California prayed for rain. Something to quench the climate-change-fueled drought ‚Äî the worst in at least 1,200 years.""\n\nWaPo @sarahkaplan48 is too dumb to wonder what caused the drought 1,200 years ago?ü§î\n\nNon-stop propaganda."
"Carbon dioxide is the lowest it has been in 600 million yrs - and the small recent increase is not enough to reverse this dangerous trend. All life will perish at 150ppm. At the end of the most recent glacial period 14,000yrs ago CO2 had fallen to 180ppm."
"Saad, YOU genuinely don‚Äôt understand how hurricanes are related to climate change. The answer is, they aren't. Numbers of landfalling hurricanes have FALLEN. There's been no increase in either the # or the strength of hurricanes. \n\nYou know what actually IS a ""major problem""?"
"Polar bears used to be the poster child of climate change. But their numbers have been increasing: from 5-10k #polarbears in the 1960s, up to around 26k today. We don‚Äôt hear this news. Instead, campaigners just quietly stopped using them in their activism.\"
"Every additional CO2 molecule emitted to the atmosphere has less warming potential.\n\nThere's only so much energy reflected from Earth. As it's trapped by GHG molecules, the amount of energy left to be trapped by subsequent GHG molecules is reduced.\"
"Enjoy your new electric vehicle. But when the battery dies it could $44,000 to replace. The technology is too new, there are no chargers yet and once hydrocarbon fuel has been demolished there will hot be any power that anyone can afford."
"The climate is not changing. We won't know if it 'has' changed for 50 years in the future. That's because climate is an accumulation of past records of weather. Usually, change is centuries and highly localised. So called emissions are insignificant. Try termites, natural cycles"
"Coastal erosion is a natural phenomenon. Development worsens it.\n\n3mm/yr sea-level rise -- which has been occurring for 150+ years -- is irrelevant."
"Polar Bear Habitat More Extensive in Most Areas of the Arctic Compared to Previous¬†Years"
"The early mammal reptiles, the dionapsids, cooevolved with dinosaurs before the end Permian. We are mammals, so mammal forbears were around for 300m years. Life took a giant leap in the Cambrian explosion 540m years ago. Climate and life coexisted in hotter times. We are tropical"
"What momentum?\n\nChina and India both announced they will burn more coal and Germany wants to help by selling coal plant technology.\n\nThe US is burning 20% more coal in 2021 than in 2020 and the world is back to burning 100 million barrels of oil per day."
"Remember the global warming con is about CO2-driven warming‚Ä¶ not all warming, which has many causes."
"No poor country has been harmed by 'climate change'... the Maldives, e.g., has actually gained land area since 2000.\n\nThese scoundrels aim to use the climate hoax as an excuse to get out of debt repayment... leaving US taxpayers on the hook"
"Per the most recent IPCC climate science report:\n\nNo evidence exists that any specific weather event is directly driven by so-called man-made climate change from increased carbon dioxide in Earth‚Äôs atmosphere."
"Remove the two non-CO2 related effects of the past 30 years (1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption and 1998+ El Nino) and the global warming 'pause' dates back to the dawn of global warming hysteria. h/t [deleted mention] \n\nCO2 warming is a hoax."

"A few points:\n\n1. CO2 emissions have not caused a single species to go extinct anywhere.\n\n2. CO2 emissions have contributed to the planet carrying more life now than ever.\n\n3. Species may be threatened by development and hunting, but not emissions."
"The climate hoax is out of control."
"These are scientific studies that measure air bubbles in ice or isotopes from sedimentary rocks. It's a very precise science. We have a far better idea of past climate than we do by making guesses about the unknown future. All forecasts of a doomsday future use computer models."

"Oh George... oh George... your sill little chart shows temps rose 1.4 degrees from 1850, 170 years. This is from the 3nd of the 500 year Little Ice Age, so you have to expect it to warm up a bit. Does that make sense to you Oh George. Oh George, you are a nincompoop."
"There Is No Detectable Link Between Greenland‚Äôs Climate And Atmospheric CO2¬†Changes"
"Very few scientists have ever tried to write a paper on the principles of the greenhouse effect hypothesis. Most just start with the implicit unquestioned assumptions. It's a crock of a theory. Arrhenius and Ekholm had no idea the radiative equilibrium T of CO2 is only ~206K."
"This is weather. Climate is a definition based on long-term measurements. The UN climate fear campaign has not been going long enough to be considered climate. Weather is all the random anomalies and fluctuations going on around the world. Red is a dishonest alarm device."
"One great benefit from higher CO2 of course is the infusion of green life it would drive. Carbon dioxide is in long term decline and this is the greatest peril life has faced since the end Permian extinction. It could end carbon based life. Other types of life would then emerge."
